/**
 * The `issue` private-report channel: the unredacted report lands as one exact-titled issue on the private target repo,
 * the one GitHub-ACL-private channel a public run has under PAT auth. The body is REPLACED each run (prior reports stay
 * in the edit history) and the state mirrors the run: open needs attention, closed is all well.
 *
 * `issue`             -> written every run
 * `issue-on-failure`  -> created only when the run needs attention; a healthy run closes a still-open issue (body included) or touches nothing
 *
 * Shaped like a SectionModule (ENDPOINTS, a permission) so the mock routes, USED_PATHS, and the PAT prose pick it up,
 * but never registered in sections/registry.ts: report delivery is infrastructure that writes even in check mode.
