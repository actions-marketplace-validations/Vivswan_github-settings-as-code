# Examples

A cookbook of settings.yml files. Every settings example on this page runs through the real document validation in CI, so the shapes stay current. What each section manages, which token permission it needs, and whether its undeclared entries are deleted or kept is specified in the [Sections table](../reference/sections.md); the cross-section rules live under [Semantics](../reference/semantics.md). This page shows shapes, not behavior.

One rule frames everything below: only declared keys are applied or compared. A section, or a field inside one, that the file does not mention is never touched. The rule has edges worth knowing; the last two bend it where the API forces their hand, as the [Sections table](../reference/sections.md) notes:

- **Full-payload entries:** a ruleset is applied with a full-payload PUT, so a key the entry omits but the live ruleset holds is drift in check and a refused write in apply; [Semantics](../reference/semantics.md) has the edges.
- **Labels and milestones** work the other way: only the fields you declare are sent, so an omitted description or state is left alone.
- **Classic `protection`:** inside a declared `protection` object the classic API requires all four core keys, so apply fills the ones you omit with `null` (see [Classic branch protection](#classic-branch-protection) below).
- **`actions`:** declaring any base permissions key (or `selected_actions`, which infers `allowed_actions: selected`) makes the base PUT carry `enabled: true` unless the file says otherwise. Retention-, cache-, workflow-token-, or access-only declarations leave the base policy alone.

## A minimal file

Enough to be useful on day one: a few repository fields and the labels you actually triage with.

```yaml settings
repository:
  description: Payments service
  topics: payments, service
  has_wiki: false
  delete_branch_on_merge: true

labels:
  - name: bug
    color: "d73a4a"
    description: Something isn't working
  - name: needs-triage
    color: "ededed"
```

## A full-featured file

A single-repo file exercising most sections. `topics` accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list, and `enable_*` keys are feature toggles the section routes to their own endpoints; everything else under `repository` goes to the API verbatim.

In `rulesets`, short ref names are auto-prefixed (`staging` becomes `refs/heads/staging`) and `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` passes through; rule parameters go to the API verbatim, so rule types GitHub ships tomorrow work unchanged (see [Forward compatibility](../reference/forward-compatibility.md)). `custom_properties` sets values for properties the organization has already defined (a `value: null` unsets one), so it applies to org-owned repositories only - on a personal account the section skips with a note.

## Classic branch protection

`branches` is the classic per-branch protection API, kept for Probot compatibility; rulesets are the modern replacement. The declared `protection` object is the PUT payload, with one adjustment: the classic API rejects a payload missing any of its four core keys (`required_status_checks`, `enforce_admins`, `required_pull_request_reviews`, `restrictions`), so apply fills omitted core keys with `null`.

A `null` there means "off", so an omitted `enforce_admins` is turned off, not left alone. Declare every core key you want to keep; check mode reports an omitted-but-live core key as drift before an apply would null it away.

```yaml settings
branches:
  - name: main
    protection:
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 1
      enforce_admins: true
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts: [all-green]
      restrictions: null
```

Two protection surfaces the REST API cannot express ride GraphQL under the hood, declared as ordinary keys:

- `force_push_bypassers` lists who may force push: a bare login is a user, `org/team-slug` a team, `app/slug` a GitHub App.
- `required_deployments` requires deployments to the named environments before merging; `null` turns the requirement off. Declare the environments in the same file - the `environments` section applies first.

An entry whose name is a wildcard pattern (`release/*`) is a classic RULE rather than a branch: it reconciles entirely through GraphQL and its protection accepts only the keys with exact GraphQL equivalents, so prefer rulesets for new pattern-based configuration.

```yaml settings
environments:
  - name: production
branches:
  - name: main
    protection:
      enforce_admins: true
      force_push_bypassers: [octocat, my-org/release-team, app/deploy-bot]
      required_deployments:
        environments: [production]
  - name: release/*
    protection:
      required_linear_history: true
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts: [all-green]
```

## What null means

For most sections, leaving a key out means "do not touch it". Three resource-level declarations give an explicit `null` a meaning of its own.

`pages: null` declares the Pages site off. Apply deletes an existing site; an absent `pages` key leaves the site alone.

```yaml settings
pages: null
```

`interaction_limits: null` clears an active repository-level interaction limit - the base limit only; the pull request creation cap and its bypass list are separate resources a `null` never touches. An absent key leaves whatever limit is live untouched.

```yaml settings
interaction_limits: null
```

`protection: null` on a branch declares it unprotected, and apply removes existing classic protection.

```yaml settings
branches:
  - name: legacy
    protection: null
```

A `mode: render` fold keeps all three meanings: a higher `pages: null` or `interaction_limits: null` is written as the section's value even over a lower layer's declaration, and a higher `protection: null` is the branch entry's value where the two `branches` lists union by name. A `null` never removes a key; to drop a lower layer's keyed entry, write `_remove: true` on it, and the [layering guide](../operate/layering.md) has the rules.

A multi-repo `defaults-file` never merges into a target's file, so a `null` there keeps the meanings above.

A few individual fields accept `null` as a value of their own too, such as `pages.cname` to remove a custom domain; the [published schema](https://github.com/Vivswan/github-settings-as-code/blob/main/lib/settings.schema.json) marks those.

## Notes in the file

Unknown top-level sections are hard errors, so a typo cannot silently do nothing. The one exception: under a `sections` allowlist, unknown keys outside the allowlist warn instead of failing, which eases version skew; the [troubleshooting guide](../operate/troubleshooting.md) covers it.

An underscore key is not an escape hatch: the underscore marks this action's three directives, `_layering`, `_undeclared`, and `_remove` (the [layering guide](../operate/layering.md) owns them), and any other underscore key at the top level or on a list section's wrapper fails validation the same way. Inside a keyed entry, an underscore key is a field and follows the entry's open or closed shape. A note belongs in a YAML comment:

```yaml settings
# owner: platform-team, see runbook RB-112
labels:
  - name: bug
    color: "d73a4a"
```

## Where to go next

[Check mode](../operate/check-mode.md) is the safe way to try any of these files against a real repository before applying. [Multi-repo mode](../operate/multi-repo.md) reuses the same documents across a fleet, [layering](../operate/layering.md) folds several files into one, and [the undeclared policy](../reference/undeclared-policy.md) explains what happens to live resources these files do not declare, and the `_undeclared` knob that changes it.
