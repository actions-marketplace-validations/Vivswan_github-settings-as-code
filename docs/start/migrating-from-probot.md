# Migrating from the Probot Settings app

This page walks through moving a repository from the [Probot Settings app](https://github.com/repository-settings/app) to this action. The short version is the [comparison table](#compared-to-the-probot-settings-app) below. What this page adds is the walkthrough: what to expect, in what order to do things, and how to read the first check run.

## Why migrate

The app applies settings from a hosted GitHub App installation, and when something goes wrong it does nothing: there is no run log a repository owner can open, so a misconfigured or uninstalled app looks exactly like a healthy one. This action is a step in your own workflow instead. Every apply is a visible run with a log, annotations, a step summary, and a red X on failure, and `mode: check` reports drift between the file and the live repository without changing any settings. On top of that you get rulesets, a partial-success policy, a token you scope yourself, and per-call debug tracing. The [comparison table](#compared-to-the-probot-settings-app) below lists the differences one by one.

## Compared to the Probot Settings app

| | Probot Settings app | This action |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery | GitHub App you install (hosted by a third party, or self-hosted) | A step in your own workflow; no app installation, no third party |
| Failure visibility | Silent: no run log a repo owner can open; a misconfigured or uninstalled app just does nothing | Every apply is a workflow run with a log, annotations, a step summary, and a red X on failure |
| Drift detection | None | mode: check reports drift between the file and the live repo, exits 1 when it finds any, changes no settings |
| Rulesets | Experimental upstream feature; schema may change | First class: branch, tag, and push targets, upsert by name; undeclared rulesets kept by default, `_undeclared: delete` opts into deletion |
| Partial success policy | None | on-missing-permission: fail or warn, plus required-sections as a minimum-requirements floor |
| Token | App installation token; its scope is invisible in the repo | A PAT you mint and scope yourself; permission errors name the exact missing permission |
| Org-level shared config | Yes (org _settings repo with extends) | Yes: `mode: merge` folds shared layers into each repository's document, and multi-repo mode applies per-repo files (repos-dir), each repo's own settings.yml (repos input), or a defaults-file fallback for repositories without one; no hosted app needed |
| Call transparency | None | Every API call is traced as a debug line (method, path, payload, status, timing) when debug logging is on |

The one Probot-family feature without a direct equivalent is suborg-level grouping (safe-settings' .github/suborgs layer); here the layers are settings files folded by `mode: merge` (see the [layering guide](../operate/layering.md)). Everything else in Probot's schema is supported, plus the rows above.

## What carries over as-is

Your existing settings.yml keeps working for `repository`, `labels`, `branches`, `collaborators`, `teams`, and `milestones`: their original Probot shapes remain compatible, including label renames via `new_name` and `protection: null` to remove branch protection. For the list sections among them the compatible shape is the plain array - the wrapped `{_undeclared, entries}` form is this action's own extension on top. This list is the parity claim the contract tests pin. The sections outside that list (`rulesets`, `autolinks`, `actions`, `workflows`, `pages`, `code_scanning_default_setup`, and the rest) are not covered by the parity guarantee; the check run below tells you whether such a section validates as-is.

YAML anchors, aliases, and merge keys (`<<`) resolve as they did under the app's js-yaml parser, so a label list built from one `&base` entry and `<<: *base` variants keeps its meaning.

## What changed on purpose

The delivery model is a workflow plus a fine-grained PAT, not an app installation. You mint the token, scope it to exactly the sections your file declares, and save it as a repository secret; permission errors name the exact grant to add. See [Token permissions](../reference/permissions.md).

Failures are loud. An unknown top-level key in the settings file is a hard error, not a silent no-op, because a misspelled section that quietly did nothing is the app's failure mode this action exists to replace; an unknown underscore key is one too, so a note goes in a YAML comment. The closed sections also reject entry keys they do not recognize: in `collaborators` and `teams` a misspelled `permission` key would silently grant the default role, and in `workflows` the enable/disable calls send no payload, so an unrecognized key would silently do nothing. [Forward compatibility](../reference/forward-compatibility.md) lists the full closed set.

The engine is stateless. There is no state file and nothing is stored between runs; resources are matched by their natural names, and only declared keys are ever applied or compared. Removing a section from the file stops managing it; it does not revert anything.

Rulesets are first class. Your `branches` section keeps working, and you can optionally move protection to `rulesets`, which cover branch, tag, and push targets. Undeclared rulesets are kept by default - deleting them is an explicit opt-in (`_undeclared: delete`), so removing protection stays a deliberate action.

Deletions still exist where the app had them: undeclared labels are deleted by default (Probot parity), and so are undeclared autolinks, collaborators, Actions variables, and Copilot agents variables - plus, within a declared per-environment key, that environment's variables and deployment branch-policy patterns. Nothing else is ever deleted implicitly; the [Sections table](../reference/sections.md) states each section's default in its Undeclared default column, and the check run lists everything an apply would delete before you let it.

## Step by step

1. Keep your existing `.github/settings.yml` where it is. The default `settings-file` input reads the same path the app did.
2. Uninstall the Probot Settings app, so two writers do not race on the same settings.
3. Create a fine-grained PAT and save it as a repository secret. Grant only the permissions for the sections your file declares; the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) walks through this.
4. Add the workflow with `mode: check` for the first run:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/settings.yml
name: Apply Settings
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: [.github/settings.yml]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  apply:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: Vivswan/github-settings-as-code@v2 # x-release-please-major
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_TOKEN }}
          mode: check
```

5. Run it once from the Actions tab (workflow_dispatch) and read the output. You will see two kinds of findings: validation errors, which reject the file before any section runs, and drift lines, which list each difference between the file and the live repository, including anything an apply would delete.
6. Fix the file section by section and re-run check until the findings are only changes you intend.
7. Remove `mode: check`. From then on every push that touches the settings file applies it.

### A worked fix

Suppose the old file carries a misspelled entry key in `collaborators`, say `permision: maintain`. The check run fails during upfront validation, before any section has touched the repository, with a message naming the entry: `collaborators[octocat]: declares "permision", which this section does not recognize (known keys: username, permission)`. The message also says what the typo would have done silently: granted the default `push` role instead of the intended one. The fix is the spelling:

```yaml settings
collaborators:
  - username: octocat
    permission: maintain
```

Re-run check. Once the report is clean, or shows only the drift you expect, switch to apply.

## Organization-wide configuration

The app's `extends` inheritance, where repositories pull shared settings from an org settings repository, maps to two mechanisms:

- Composition is `mode: merge` layers: the shared file is the lowest layer, the repository's own file the highest, and a merge step writes the document the apply step runs. The [layering guide](../operate/layering.md) owns the rules and has the two-step workflow.
- Delivery at org scale is multi-repo mode: one admin repository applies per-repo files (`repos-dir`) or each repository's own settings.yml (`repos`), with a `defaults-file` as the fallback for repositories that have no file. No hosted app is in the loop. The [multi-repo guide](../operate/multi-repo.md) owns those rules.

## At org scale: the shadow run

An organization with two hundred repositories should not migrate them one at a time, and should not uninstall the app on faith. Run this action in the app's shadow first:

1. Inventory the existing files into a `repos-dir`: each repository's `.github/settings.yml` copied to `.github/repos/<name>.yml` in the admin repository (a `gh api` loop over the repo list does it in one pass).
2. Run the whole directory in `mode: check` while the app is still installed. Validation errors surface before any section runs, so one fleet check finds every misspelled key in every file at once.
3. Read the results. A clean target means this action and the app agree on that repository; drift means either the app was not actually enforcing the file or the file uses something outside the [parity set](#what-carries-over-as-is). Fix files until the remaining drift is intended.
4. Uninstall the app, then flip cohorts to apply in stages rather than all at once; the [playbooks](../playbooks/README.md) page shows a ring-based rollout that fits here directly.

Two writers must never race on the same settings, so the uninstall in step 4 comes before the first apply, and the check-only shadow period is what makes that safe.
