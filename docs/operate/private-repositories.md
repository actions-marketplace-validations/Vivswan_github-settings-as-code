# Private repositories

When a run manages repositories more private than its own logs, the details it prints become a leak. This page covers the `private-repos` redaction that closes that leak, what a redacted run still shows, and the `private-report` channels that deliver the full detail privately. It matters to anyone whose admin repository is public (or merely less restricted) while some of its multi-repo targets are private or internal.

GitHub Actions has no log-level access control. Run logs, step summaries, and uploaded artifacts inherit the repository's visibility, so a public admin repo managing a private target would print that target's slug, its live settings, and its API error bodies where anyone can read them. The only GitHub-ACL-private channel a public run has is another repository the token can reach.

To stop the leak, `private-repos: redact` (the default) hides every private or internal target from the public view. The target's slug becomes a `private repository #N` placeholder, its live values and error bodies become `hidden (private repository)`, and each slug is registered with the runner's secret masker so it cannot resurface in a stray log line. The visibility check fails closed: a repository the probe cannot prove public is redacted anyway. A target equal to `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is never redacted, because a repository acting on itself discloses nothing new. Set `private-repos: show` only when the run's own logs are already private.

The decision comes down to the policy and what the visibility probe finds:

| Condition | Redacted? |
|---|---|
| `private-repos: show` | no, everything is revealed |
| target is `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (self) | no, the carve-out applies |
| probe proves the target public | no |
| probe proves the target private or internal | yes |
| probe cannot determine visibility | yes, redaction fails closed |

## What a redacted run still shows

Redaction hides values, not the shape of the outcome. The public surfaces still carry the safe skeleton of each target. The step summary shows, per target, the overall result (`failed`, `drift`, `partial`, `skipped`, `applied`, `clean`, `snapshot`), each section's key and status, and the HTTP status code on a failed or skipped section; the `repos-result` output carries `{result, source, skipped-sections}` per target, keyed by the placeholder. These are closed enumerations and numeric codes, safe to show, and enough to tell whether the fleet is healthy and which section broke. What they never carry is the slug, a live setting, a desired setting, or an API error message.

## One seal, every mode

Every target ends the same way, whichever mode ran it: its lines and its end state go through one channel, which closes open for a shown target and sealed for a hidden one. Only the seal's projections open it, and they render the public view alone. No mode has a redaction path of its own.

| Mode | What the seal holds | What the public view shows |
|---|---|---|
| `repository:` apply or check (one target) | the slug, section detail, the transcript | `private repository #1`, section statuses, the one-line result |
| `repos` / `repos-dir` apply or check | the same, per target | `private repository #N` in target order |
| `snapshot-file` (one target) | the slug, the notes (a secret's name, a webhook's URL), the file path, the transcript | `private repository #1`, section statuses; the document reaches only the file |
| `snapshot-dir` | the same, per target | `private repository #N`; the File column reads `hidden (private repository)` |

Two consequences of the shared path:

- The label is `private repository #N` in every mode. A run over one repository is a fleet of one, so its label is `#1`, in the log line, the withheld-report notice, and the `artifact` report heading alike.
- A hidden target that fails, drifts, or is skipped gets one closed-value annotation (`private repository #N: failed - labels (403). details hidden: ...`), in snapshot mode too. A healthy hidden target says nothing.

The sealed transcript is what a private report mirrors. Snapshot mode rejects `private-report`, so its sealed transcript is never delivered anywhere: the written file is the private record, and the [snapshot guide](snapshot.md#many-repositories) says what to do with it on a public admin repository.

## Seeing the full detail

Three ways to read the unredacted detail, in rough order of convenience.

The first is to run from a context whose logs are already private. Move the workflow into the target repository itself (the self carve-out gives full logs safely), or keep the admin repo private and set `private-repos: show`.

The second is to reproduce locally. The action is a plain Node bundle - build it first with `bun install && bun run build:bundle` (it is not committed) - so the same PAT and the same inputs reproduce the run on your machine, where the logs stay local. Put the PAT in a `YOUR_PAT` variable; a shell variable name cannot contain a hyphen, so pass the hyphenated inputs through `env`:

```bash
bun install && bun run build:bundle
env "INPUT_TOKEN=$YOUR_PAT" 'INPUT_REPOSITORY=owner/name' 'INPUT_PRIVATE-REPOS=show' \
  node lib/index.js
```

Every input maps to an `INPUT_<NAME>` variable, uppercased with dashes kept (so `private-repos` is `INPUT_PRIVATE-REPOS`).

The third is to have the run deliver a private report, described next.

## Delivering a private report

`private-report` sends the full unredacted report for each redacted target through a channel whose access control is not the public run; the default, `private-report: none`, sends nothing. Any other channel applies only to redacted targets, and only to those the visibility probe proves private or internal: an unknown visibility is redacted from the public view but excluded from delivery, so the report never reaches a repository that might be public. It is rejected alongside `private-repos: show`. The report mirrors the run's log, delivery stays live in `mode: check`, and a delivery failure only warns; it never changes the target's or the run's result.

`private-report: issue` posts each target's report to a reused issue on that target repository, where the repository's own access control protects it. Prefer this channel unless your readers lack GitHub access to the targets.

- **Which issue:** found by the marker label, or by its exact title when someone removed the label. Either way it must be one of the action's own reports: the body carries the report heading. A same-titled issue you opened by hand is left alone, unless its body pastes a report verbatim.
- **Whose issue:** the creator does not matter, so a rotated PAT reuses the issue instead of opening a second one. With several reports, an open one wins, then the newest.
- **Each run:** the body is replaced; the issue opens when the target fails or drifts and closes when it is healthy. The run log announces every write with the placeholder, never the slug: `report: updated issue #7 in private repository #1` (or `created`), and `report: created label "settings-as-code-report" in private repository #1` when the delivery creates the marker label. A write that landed before a later step failed is announced the same way, ahead of the warning.
- **Permission:** the PAT needs `"Issues"` (read and write) on every target repository, on top of the section permissions.

`private-report: issue-on-failure` is the quiet variant of `issue`. When a target fails (or drifts in check mode) it behaves identically: the reused, marker-labelled report issue is written and opened. On a healthy run it only looks up an open report issue; one left over from an earlier failure is updated with the healthy report and closed, and when there is none, nothing is written - no issue, no label, zero notification noise - and the log says so: `report: nothing to deliver for private repository #1`. A repository that never fails never sees an issue, at the cost that healthy runs' reports are not delivered anywhere; choose `issue` or `artifact` when you need the report mirror on every run.

Two caveats on the quiet variant. If the settings declare a `labels` section, the `settings-as-code-report` marker label is still injected into it, so the apply creates the label even on healthy repositories (a label, not a notification). And if someone removes the marker label while a report issue is open, the healthy path cannot find the issue, so it stays open until the next failing run recreates the label and reclaims it. Everything else matches `issue`: the same delivery gate, the same Issues grant (the healthy lookup is a read; the open and close are writes), and delivery still runs in `mode: check`.

`private-report: artifact` concatenates the report for every proven-private target into one document, encrypts it to an age recipient, and uploads it as the workflow artifact `settings-as-code-private-report` (file `private-report.md.age`). Use it when the people who need the report cannot be given repository access, since the archive travels with the run rather than living in the target repo. This channel needs the Actions artifact service, so it does not work on GitHub Enterprise Server (the `@actions/artifact` client has no GHES backend): there the run warns and uploads nothing.

Access control on the artifact channel is key possession, so the key setup matters. Generate a keypair on your own machine; the private key must never touch GitHub:

```bash
age-keygen -o key.txt
```

`key.txt` holds the secret identity; keep it off GitHub. The command also prints the public recipient (`age1...`), safe to commit: pass it as `report-public-key`. It is required when `private-report` is `artifact` and rejected otherwise; a malformed recipient fails the run at startup.

To read a report, download the artifact (the browser gives a ZIP to unzip; `gh run download` extracts it) and decrypt it with the identity file:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> -n settings-as-code-private-report
age -d -i key.txt private-report.md.age
```

One caveat weighs against this channel: the ciphertext is downloadable by anyone during the artifact's retention window, and copies persist after that. If the age key is ever compromised, every archived run it encrypted becomes readable retroactively. The `issue` channel has no such standing exposure.

## What redaction does and does not protect

Redaction protects the target's live state and its errors. It does not retroactively hide a name you already published. In a public admin repo, the names in the `repos` input and the paths and contents of `repos-dir` files are already public, so redaction there is limited:

| Target source | What is public regardless | What redaction protects |
|---|---|---|
| `repos` explicit list | the target name | live state, desired state, errors |
| `repos-dir` central file | the target name and the desired settings in the committed file | live state, errors |
| `repos: "*"` discovery | nothing | the name, live state, desired state, and errors |

Only `repos: "*"` discovery gives a target true non-disclosure, because its name never appears in a committed file or input. For the other two sources, the name is self-disclosed the moment you commit the workflow.

The visibility probe drives two decisions that fail closed in opposite directions. Redaction fails closed toward hiding: a target the probe cannot prove public is redacted. Delivery fails closed toward silence: a report is sent only when the probe proves the target private or internal, so an unknown visibility redacts the public view yet withholds the private report rather than risk posting it to a repository that might be public.

A closing point on escape hatches: on a public repository, an unencrypted artifact or a debug log is not a private channel. Both inherit the run's public visibility. That is the whole reason the artifact channel encrypts, and the reason redaction cannot be waved away with `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`.

None of this requires a dedicated account. If you already run the fleet under a machine user, it happens to fit well here: you can scope its PAT to least privilege, point `repos: "*"` discovery at only what it owns, and get bot-named authorship on the report issues. That is a convenience, not a prerequisite; a personal PAT with the right permissions works the same way.
