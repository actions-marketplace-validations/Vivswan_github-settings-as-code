# Troubleshooting

Errors from this action are written to carry their own fix: the failing request, the API's message verbatim, and what to change. The step summary table shows the outcome per section, so start there. This page covers the symptoms where the message alone benefits from context: denials that are not what they look like, limits, validation errors, and runs that do not match the code you think they are running.

## A section fails with "the token was denied ..."

What you see: an error annotation naming the section, the denied request with its HTTP status, and advice starting "To fix, grant" that names the exact fine-grained PAT permission the section needs.

What it means: the token lacks that section's grant. Each section's permission is listed in the [Sections table](../reference/sections.md). The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot hold most of them (Administration in particular), so a missing or under-scoped PAT is the usual cause.

What to do: edit the PAT's permissions as the message says (see [Token permissions](../reference/permissions.md)). If you would rather skip sections the token cannot reach, set `on-missing-permission: warn`: denied sections are skipped with a warning instead of failing the run, and when nothing else drifts or fails the result is `partial` and the run stays green. The `required-sections` input names sections that must still fully apply even under `warn`.

One related surprise: under the default `on-missing-permission: fail`, an apply run probes every declared section read-only before writing anything. If any probe is denied you get error annotations prefixed `preflight:` and nothing at all is applied, by design; the API has no transactions, so the barrier prevents a half-applied repository. See [Semantics](../reference/semantics.md).

## A 404 for something that exists

Fine-grained tokens surface a missing Administration permission as a 404, not a 403, on admin endpoints; GitHub hides the resource rather than admit it exists. The action treats both statuses as permission errors, and a 404 denial appends "(a 404 here can also mean the resource does not exist)". Check the grant first. If the grant is right, check the resource: the repository slug, a workflow file path.

Where GitHub's response body names the definite meaning, the action reads the body instead of the status: the branch protection PUT's 404 "Branch not found" fails the `branches` section with "create the branch, or remove it from the settings file". That is never a permission denial, so `on-missing-permission: warn` does not skip it, and the outcome is the same whether or not the token also holds Contents (with Contents the section reads the missing branch off its probe and fails before the PUT).

On the `secret_scanning_custom_patterns` endpoints a 404 has a third reading, which the denial message carries: secret scanning is not enabled for the repository (it requires GitHub Advanced Security on private repositories). Enabling scanning and declaring patterns cannot land in ONE apply under the default `on-missing-permission: fail`: the preflight barrier probes every declared section read-only before anything is written, so the patterns list 404s and aborts the run before the `repository` section could enable scanning via `security_and_analysis`. Either enable scanning first (a separate run, or by hand in the repository's security settings), or set `on-missing-permission: warn` for the bootstrap run - the first apply then enables scanning and skips the patterns section with a warning, and the next apply converges.

## A 412 on secret scanning custom patterns

What you see: a `secret_scanning_custom_patterns` write fails with a 412 and the advice "the pattern changed on GitHub between this run's read and its write (stale custom_pattern_version); re-run the workflow".

What it means: the pattern updates and deletes carry the version each pattern had when this run listed them, so a pattern someone edited on GitHub mid-run is not silently overwritten - GitHub rejects the stale write instead. Nothing is broken and nothing was clobbered.

What to do: re-run the workflow. The fresh run reads the current versions and converges; if the 412 repeats, someone (or something) is editing the patterns concurrently on every run, and that editor is the thing to find.

## A 403 that is not about a grant

Two other things arrive as 403. First, rate limiting: both the primary limit and secondary (abuse) limits can be delivered as 403. The action recognizes these by the API's own message and reports them as rate limits, never as missing permissions. Second, feature policies: on a few endpoints a 403 means something other than the token. An org- or enterprise-managed policy can lock the Actions cache limits, code scanning default setup needs Advanced Security on private repositories, and Git LFS can be disabled account-wide. For Git LFS the denial message itself carries a note saying so; for the others the caveat lives in that section's row of the [COVERAGE.md Supported table](https://github.com/Vivswan/github-settings-as-code/blob/main/COVERAGE.md#supported).

## Rate limited

What you see: a failure ending "The API rate limit was hit; re-run the workflow after the limit resets, or use a token with a higher rate limit".

What it means: the retries already happened, or were deliberately skipped because the wait was too long. Rate limits (429 and secondary limits) are retried automatically, honoring Retry-After and the rate-limit reset; transient 5xx and network failures are retried on their own backoff. Both paths allow up to two retries, and a reset more than 60 seconds away fails loudly instead of stalling the workflow (see [Semantics](../reference/semantics.md)). By the time this error surfaces, the run has waited as long as it reasonably could.

What to do: re-run after the reset. If a multi-repo run keeps hitting the limit, reduce its scope: fewer targets per run, or a `sections` allowlist so each target makes fewer calls.

## "unknown top-level section in ..." (or "sections")

What you see: the run fails during validation, naming the unknown keys and listing every known section name.

What it means: a misspelled section that silently did nothing would break the loud-failure promise, so unknown top-level keys are hard errors (see [Forward compatibility](../reference/forward-compatibility.md)).

What to do: the message names both options. Fix the typo, keeping any note as a YAML comment (an underscore key is not a private note: `_owner_notes: ...` fails with its own error naming the two directives the underscore is reserved for):

```yaml settings
# owner notes: contact the platform team before editing this file
labels:
  - name: bug
    color: d73a4a
```

Or, when the file is written for a newer action version than the one running (version skew during an upgrade), set the `sections` input: unknown keys outside the allowlist downgrade to warnings instead of failing the run.

## The run fails with a 401

The message says "The token was rejected as invalid or expired". This is not a permissions problem: the PAT itself expired or was revoked, or the secret the `token` input reads holds a stale value. Mint or rotate the token and update the secret.

## Check mode "fails" with nothing broken

`mode: check` exits 1 on any drift by design, so a red scheduled check run means the file and the repository disagree, not that something errored. The drift lines in the log list each difference. See the [check mode guide](check-mode.md).

## Turning on debug logging

Every API call the action makes is traced as a debug line: method, path, request payload, response status, and timing. Debug lines are hidden in normal runs; re-run the workflow with "[Enable debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)" checked, or set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true`. The trace never prints the token: the authorization header is not part of the trace line, and a token stored as a repository secret is masked by the runner wherever it appears in output. For redacted private targets in multi-repo mode, the traced path collapses to `<redacted>` and the payload is dropped entirely. Failures do not need debug mode; every error already carries the API's message and the fix, so reach for the trace when you need to see the requests that succeeded.

## Behavior does not match src/ (missing or stale bundle)

When you run the action from a ref (`uses: your-fork/github-settings-as-code@your-branch`), what executes is `lib/index.js`, the bundle, not the TypeScript under `src/`. The release tags (`vX.Y.Z`) and the moving major tag carry a freshly built bundle; branches do not - the bundle is not committed on main. So on a fork or working branch, build it yourself: run `bun run build:bundle` and commit the result on your branch (and `bun run build:schema` if you changed the settings types). A ref without the bundle fails to start; a branch where you rebuilt `src/` without rebuilding behaves like the old code and no error tells you so. The rebuild is on you.
